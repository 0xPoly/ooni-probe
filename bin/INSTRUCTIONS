That Makefile is for testing that the tests work. However, not
all of the tests have a line in the Makefile yet. If you would
like to add things to it, feel free to. Or even to write OONI
unittests for realsies.

The 'old_ooniprobe' script used to call the old script for
starting up tests, ooni/ooniprobe.py, but I have just removed
ooniprobe.py and kept the remaining useful pieces in
ooni/utils/legacy.py where the rest of the new API for running
old code lives. I think they are happier if we keep them together.

tl;dr: the thing you actually want to use is the script called
       'ooniprobe'.
