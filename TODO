This is a list of things to be done on ooni-probe.

Once you have completed something you should add a
note to this file stating what you have done under
the item.

Migrate code from old
---------------------

Migrate all the interesting parts of the old code to the new.

It's important to make the new code asych and based on Twisted.
It should respect the design goals of the new ooni-probe model.

New things to develop
---------------------

These are either components specific to the new refactor of ooni
or that we haven't yet figured out how they should work.

* Design and implement the Node Factory

* Design and implement the Network Node and the Code Exec node classes

New things to test
------------------

* Some of the tests still give errors. This is top priority.

* The submit-patch script is still a bit janky, and could use
  some sprucing up.

* The Makefile that I made to serve a quick check for whether or not the tests
  are broken could use some more tests added to it.  One thing is that some
  tests take certain types of input files, others take none at all, and
  nowhere is this presented to someone trying to run a test. So, the informing
  users/testers bit can be worked on, and the testing. Obviously we're going
  to want something more robust that a 20 LOC Makefile pretty fast.
