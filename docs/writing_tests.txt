There are two modes of writing tests.

The first kind of mechanism relied of writing a test that uses blocking code
and each instance of it is run inside of a separate thread. Beware that your
blocking code must be thread safe to run properly (as is obvious :P)

The other menthod invloves having some knowledge about twisted. The test you
will write will be written in twisted and should implement async style non
blocking architecture.

It is recommended that tests are written using the second pattern and the first
should only be used for runnign tests that have been previously written.
