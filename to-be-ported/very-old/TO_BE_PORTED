The tests in this directory are very old, and have neither been ported to
Twisted, nor to the new twisted.trial API framework. Although, they are not
old in the sense of the *seriously old* OONI code which was written two years
ago.

These tests should be updated at least to use Twisted.

If you want to hack on something care free, feel free to mess with these files
because it would be difficult to not improve on them.
