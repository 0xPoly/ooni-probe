    """
    This is the base of the OONI nettest universe. When you write a nettest
    you will subclass this object.

    * inputs: can be set to a static set of inputs. All the tests (the methods
      starting with the "test" prefix) will be run once per input.  At every run
      the _input_ attribute of the TestCase instance will be set to the value of
      the current iteration over inputs.  Any python iterable object can be set
      to inputs.

    * inputFile: attribute should be set to an array containing the command line
      argument that should be used as the input file. Such array looks like
      this:

          ``["commandlinearg", "c", "default value" "The description"]``

      The second value of such arrray is the shorthand for the command line arg.
      The user will then be able to specify inputs to the test via:

          ``ooniprobe mytest.py --commandlinearg path/to/file.txt``

      or

          ``ooniprobe mytest.py -c path/to/file.txt``


    * inputProcessor: should be set to a function that takes as argument an
      open file descriptor and it will return the input to be passed to the test
      instance.

    * name: should be set to the name of the test.

    * author: should contain the name and contact details for the test author.
      The format for such string is as follows:

          ``The Name <email@example.com>``

    * version: is the version string of the test.

    * requiresRoot: set to True if the test must be run as root.

    * optFlags: 
          is assigned a list of lists. Each list represents a flag
          parameter, as so:

        optFlags = [
            ['verbose', 'v', 'Makes it tell you what it doing.'],
            ['quiet', 'q', 'Be vewy vewy quiet.']]

    As you can see, the first item is the long option name (prefixed with
    '--' on the command line), followed by the short option name (prefixed with
    '-'), and the description. The description is used for the built-in handling of
    the --help switch, which prints a usage summary.

    * optParameters: 
          is much the same, except the list also contains a default value:

        optParameters = [
            ['outfile', 'O', 'outfile.log', 'Description...']]

    * usageOptions: 
          a subclass of twisted.python.usage.Options for more advanced command
          line arguments fun.

    * requiredOptions: a list containing the name of the options that are
                       required for proper running of a test.

    * localOptions: contains the parsed command line arguments.

    Quirks:
    Every class that is prefixed with test *must* return a twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.

        format and you want to set the input attribute of the test to something
        that you will be able to properly process.
