    """
    This is a hack to overcome a bug in one of pythons core functions. It is
    located inside of copy_reg and is called _reduce_ex.

    Some background on the issue can be found here:

    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/569754/how-to-tell-for-which-object-attribute-pickle
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2049849/why-cant-i-pickle-this-object

    There was also an open bug on the pyyaml trac repo, but it got closed because
    they could not reproduce.
    http://pyyaml.org/ticket/190

    It turned out to be easier to patch the python core library than to monkey
    patch yaml.

    XXX see if there is a better way. sigh...
