I have moved here all the pieces of code that are either not being used
anywhere or that should probably not be part of OONIProbe.

They are very neat pieces of code, though I have not tester their
functionality, since there are no examples of how they should be called or
used in the repo.

I believe they should go on a separate branch or on another repo called
something like "python class kung foo".
